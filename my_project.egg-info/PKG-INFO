# 🕵️ Counterfeit Product Detection Challenge

Can you build a model that detects counterfeit products? You have **1 hour** to create the best solution. 

## 🎯 The Challenge

You are given a dataset of e-commerce product listings. Each listing has various features like seller rating, price, shipping time, etc. Your task is to predict whether a product is **genuine** (`False`) or **counterfeit** (`True`).

The team with the best combination of **accuracy** and **speed** wins! 🏆

## 📊 Dataset

The data is in the `data/` folder:

| File | Rows | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `products_train.csv` | 1000 | Training your model |
| `products_test.csv` | 100 | Local testing |
| `products_eval.csv` | 500 | Final evaluation (used by submit script) |

### Features Available

- `category`
- `brand`
- `price`
- `seller_rating`
- `shipping_time_days`
- And more...

## 🛠️ Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure environment

Copy the example environment file and add your API key and set your team name:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set:

```
TEAM_NAME=YourTeamName
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

## 💻 Your Task

Edit `app/counterfeit_prediction_machine.py` to implement your solution. You are free to make large changes as long as:

1. The `predict()` method must:
   - Take a single product row as a `pd.Series`
   - Return `True` if counterfeit, `False` if genuine
2. You are **only** allowed to train on the train dataset
3. No obvious cheating! 🚨 Top scoring teams will need to walk through their solutions live - public shaming will be delivered for cheaters!

## 🧪 Running Tests

Validate your implementation passes the basic tests:

```bash
python -m unittest test_categorization_machine -v
```

The tests check:
- ✅ Your model can be trained without errors
- ✅ Predictions return boolean values (True/False)
- ✅ Prediction speed is reasonable (< 0.4s average per prediction)

## 🚀 Submitting Results

Submit your results to the live scoreboard! Feel free to submit as often as you want, just don't kill the API please! 🙏

```bash
python submit_results.py
```

⚠️ **Warning:** The submit script will abort if your predictions are too slow. Make sure your solution is efficient!

## 📈 Scoring

Your overall score is based on Accuracy, Precision, Recall and Speed. The best overall solution will win!

## 💡 Tips

- Look at the feature columns - some are very predictive!
- Think about the new and old way of dealing with classification problems!
- You are on the clock, split up the task/research among you in the team!
- Reach out to our TT colleagues if you find yourself in a pickle!

Good luck and have fun! 🎉
